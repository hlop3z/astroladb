title: "Why & When: Generators vs. OpenAPI"

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

`alab gen` is included as a convenience. It is the fastest way to go from a
schema definition to working, runnable code — one command, no external tooling
required.

This page explains what generators actually produce, when they are the right
choice, and when you should consume the OpenAPI schema directly instead.

## The OpenAPI schema is the real product

Every `alab` project exports an `openapi.json` file that includes standard
OpenAPI definitions plus `x-db` extensions carrying column-level metadata
(types, relationships, constraints, defaults). This file is the canonical,
machine-readable description of your data model.

Generators are **one consumer** of that schema. Any tool that reads OpenAPI — or
any script you write yourself — is an equally valid consumer.

## When to use `alab gen`

- **Prototyping and scaffolding** — get a working API layer or typed client in
  seconds.
- **Small-to-medium projects** — the built-in generators may cover everything
  you need out of the box.
- **Getting started** — generators let you explore what the schema contains
  without reading the JSON directly.

<Aside type="tip">
  Generators are a good way to bootstrap a project. If you later outgrow the
  built-in templates, you can switch to a custom codegen pipeline without
  changing your schema at all.
</Aside>

## When to use the OpenAPI schema directly

- **Production codegen pipelines** — plug `openapi.json` into your existing
  CI/CD tooling (e.g. `openapi-generator`, QuickType, Orval).
- **Custom tooling** — write your own transformer that reads exactly the fields
  and extensions you care about.
- **Established infrastructure** — if your team already has a codegen workflow,
  consuming the schema directly avoids an unnecessary abstraction layer.

<Aside type="note">
  For teams with established codegen workflows, consuming `openapi.json`
  directly gives you full control over output format, directory structure, and
  post-processing — things an opinionated generator intentionally decides for
  you.
</Aside>

## They are not mutually exclusive

You can use `alab gen` for some outputs (quick prototypes, internal tooling) and
a custom pipeline for others (production services, typed clients). Both read
from the same `openapi.json` source of truth, so they stay in sync
automatically.
