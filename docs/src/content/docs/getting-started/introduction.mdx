  Learn what Astroladb is and how it solves common database schema management
  problems.
---

Astroladb is a **language-agnostic database migration tool** that lets you
define your schema once in JavaScript and automatically generates migrations, API
specifications, and type definitions for multiple languages.

**No ORM. No framework lock-in. Just clean migrations and type exports.**

Your schema becomes the single source of truth for your entire stack.

## The Problem It Solves

| Problem                                 | Astroladb Solution                           |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ORMs tie you to one language            | Define schema once, export to any language   |
| Manual migration writing is error-prone | Auto-generate migrations from schema changes |
| Keeping API docs in sync is tedious     | OpenAPI/GraphQL generated from your schema   |
| Type definitions drift from database    | Types always match your actual schema        |

## What You Can Generate

From a single schema definition, Astroladb exports:

- **Database migrations** (PostgreSQL & SQLite)
- **OpenAPI specifications**
- **GraphQL schemas**
- **TypeScript types**
- **Go structs**
- **Python dataclasses**
- **Rust structs**

```bash
# Export everything with one command
alab export -f all
```
